This script dumps all voiced lines (and lists corresponding voice files) from an Entergram `main.snr` script.
It was created due to all known actual decompilers being broken on the newer script formats (e.g. Umineko Saku).

The usefulness of this project is dubious and temporary, but it can help with getting the most important part of the script out when nothing else will.
